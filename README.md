This project is for UNH/Trilogy Web Dev Bootcamp

Based off of Week 2: Advanced CSS

The following requirements must be met:
- working portfolio site 
- includes name, a recent photo, and links (to sections about, work, and contact)
- when a link is clicked, ui scrolls to corresponding section
- titled images of devs apps
- when presented with first app, it should be larger than others
- clicking on app image takes to deployed app
- responsive layout

Note: I am still in the production phase as a student, so I do not have any apps to show.
Therefore, my first app takes you to my github while the other two are not linked and TBA.
